# smoll-vm
just a smoll vm in c++14

I am leaving this here, not completly finished, but working. I won't add anything else to it as it was only a test, but because it is interesting and working, I won't delete it :)

I am currently working on a project using this VM (but with way more functionnalities), on a private repository, but feel free to fork this project and tweak it as you want, I won't refuse a pull-request ! ;)
